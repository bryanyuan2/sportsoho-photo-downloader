# CSV Download Log Feature

## Overview

The SportsOho Photo Downloader now includes comprehensive CSV logging functionality that tracks every photo download attempt across all pages of an album. **The downloader uses the CSV log as the primary source of truth for tracking download progress, not file existence on disk.**

## Key Features

### üìä Smart Resume Capability

- **CSV-based tracking**: Uses log file as the authoritative record of downloaded photos
- **Reliable resume**: Downloads only photos not marked as successfully downloaded in CSV
- **File-independent**: Doesn't rely on file existence checks, prevents re-downloading if files are moved/deleted
- **Progress persistence**: Maintains accurate download state across sessions

### üîÑ Intelligent Skip Logic

- Checks CSV log first before attempting any download
- Skips photos marked with 'Y' (successful) in the log
- Re-attempts photos marked with 'N' (failed) in previous runs
- No duplicate entries for already-processed URLs

### üêõ Enhanced Debugging Support

- Identifies failed downloads for automatic retry
- Provides complete audit trail of all download attempts
- Helps troubleshoot network or server issues
- Clear distinction between skipped and failed downloads

## CSV Format

Each log entry contains exactly three fields:

| Field        | Description                         | Example                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Page`       | Sequential page number (1, 2, 3...) | `1`                                                     |
| `URL`        | Full photo URL                      | `https://www.sportsoho.com/pg/photos/medium/photo1.jpg` |
| `Downloaded` | Success flag (Y/N)                  | `Y`                                                     |

## Implementation Details

### File Location

```
album-folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ photo1.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ photo2.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {albumId}-{title}.csv  ‚Üê Same name as folder
```

### Resume Logic Flow

1. **On startup**: Load existing CSV log and populate downloaded photos set
2. **During discovery**: Skip photos already marked as 'Y' in CSV
3. **During download**: Only attempt photos not in the downloaded set
4. **After download**: Add successful downloads to both CSV and memory set

### Page Numbering

- **Page 1**: The initial given URL
- **Page 2+**: Each subsequent pagination page discovered
- **Sequential**: Pages are numbered in order of processing

### Download Status

- **Y**: Photo successfully downloaded (will be skipped on resume)
- **N**: Photo download failed (will be retried on resume)
- **Skip behavior**: Photos marked 'Y' are never re-attempted, regardless of file existence

## Example Usage Scenario

### Initial Download

```bash
sportsoho-downloader https://www.sportsoho.com/pg/photos/album/11083369/
```

**Generated Log (`11083369-Swimming_Competition.csv`):**

```csv
Page,URL,Downloaded
1,https://www.sportsoho.com/pg/photos/medium/photo1.jpg,Y
1,https://www.sportsoho.com/pg/photos/medium/photo2.jpg,Y
1,https://www.sportsoho.com/pg/photos/medium/photo3.jpg,N
2,https://www.sportsoho.com/pg/photos/medium/photo4.jpg,Y
2,https://www.sportsoho.com/pg/photos/medium/photo5.jpg,Y
```

### Resume Analysis

From the log, you can see:

- **Total pages processed**: 2
- **Successful downloads**: 4 photos (will be skipped on resume)
- **Failed downloads**: 1 photo (photo3.jpg will be retried)
- **Resume behavior**: Only photo3.jpg will be attempted on next run

### Smart Resume Example

**Second run on same album:**

```bash
sportsoho-downloader https://www.sportsoho.com/pg/photos/album/11083369/
```

**Console output:**

```
Log file already exists: 11083369-Swimming_Competition.csv
Loaded 4 previously downloaded photos from log
Processing page 1: https://www.sportsoho.com/pg/photos/album/11083369/
Photo already downloaded according to log, skipping: photo1.jpg
Photo already downloaded according to log, skipping: photo2.jpg
Downloading: photo3.jpg  ‚Üê Only retry the failed one
Photo already downloaded according to log, skipping: photo4.jpg
Photo already downloaded according to log, skipping: photo5.jpg
```

## Technical Implementation

### Key Methods

1. **`loadDownloadedPhotosFromLog()`**
    - Reads existing CSV file on startup
    - Populates downloadedPhotos set with successful downloads
    - Called automatically when log file exists

2. **`initializeLogFile()`**
    - Creates CSV file with headers if new
    - Loads existing download history if file exists
    - Called when album folder is created

3. **`downloadPhoto(photoUrl)`**
    - Checks CSV-based downloadedPhotos set first
    - Skips download if photo already marked successful
    - No file system checks for skip decisions

4. **`extractPhotoUrls()`**
    - Filters out photos already in downloadedPhotos set
    - Prevents duplicate discovery of processed photos

### Error Handling

- Log loading failures don't interrupt downloads
- Missing log file triggers fresh start
- CSV corruption falls back to empty download set
- Graceful degradation ensures downloads continue

## Benefits

1. **True Resume**: CSV-based tracking ensures accurate resume regardless of file state
2. **Reliability**: No dependency on file system state for download decisions
3. **Efficiency**: Intelligent skipping prevents unnecessary re-downloads
4. **Data Integrity**: Complete audit trail with authoritative download status
5. **Flexibility**: Files can be moved/deleted without affecting resume capability
6. **Performance**: Fast CSV-based lookups vs. file system checks

This feature transforms the downloader into a production-ready tool with enterprise-level resume capabilities that work reliably across different environments and scenarios.
